# UI Fixes Applied - October 2, 2025

## ✅ Fixed Issues

### 1. Dark Mode Fix
**Problem:** Dark mode toggle wasn't working
**Solution:** Fixed the theme mode logic in `main.dart`
- Changed from simple boolean check to proper AppThemeMode enum check
- Now correctly switches between light/dark/system modes
- Theme persists and applies across all screens

**Files Modified:**
- `lib/main.dart` - Fixed theme mode switching logic

**How to Test:**
1. Go to Settings → Appearance
2. Toggle "Dark Mode" switch
3. Entire app switches to dark theme immediately
4. All screens now support both themes

### 2. Plus Button UI (Cutting into Dock)
**Problem:** Plus button was floating above dock, not cutting into it
**Solution:** Implemented BottomAppBar with CircularNotchedRectangle

- Added circular notch for FAB to sit in
- FAB now "cuts" into the dock with proper elevation
- Increased FAB size to 70x70 for better visual impact

**Files Modified:**
- `lib/screens/main_screen.dart` - Complete dock redesign

**Visual Changes:**
- ✅ FAB now has circular notch cut into dock
- ✅ Larger button (70x70 vs 60x60)
- ✅ Better shadow and elevation
- ✅ Golden gradient maintained
- ✅ Icons properly spaced around notch
- ✅ Active tab highlighted in gold

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Dark Mode Implementation
```dart
themeMode: _themeService.themeMode == AppThemeMode.dark 
    ? ThemeMode.dark 
    : _themeService.themeMode == AppThemeMode.light
        ? ThemeMode.light
        : ThemeMode.system,
```

### BottomAppBar with Notch
```dart
BottomAppBar(
  shape: const CircularNotchedRectangle(),
  notchMargin: 8,
  color: const Color(0xFF2E1065),
  // ... FAB sits in notch
)
```

✅ Navigation icons properly spaced
✅ Active tab highlighted in gold

## 🐛 Minor Issues Remaining

1. **Transaction Item Overflow (1.4px)** - Very minor visual overflow, doesn't affect functionality
2. **Budget Card Overflow (43px)** - Category cards need height adjustment (cosmetic only)
3. **Font Missing Warning** - Noto fonts warning (doesn't affect display)

These are all cosmetic and don't affect functionality.
