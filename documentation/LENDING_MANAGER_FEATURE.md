## 📊 Calculations & Logic

### Balance Calculations:
```
Outstanding Lent Balance = Total Lent - Total Lent Returned
Outstanding Borrowed Balance = Total Borrowed - Total Borrow Returned

Per Contact Balance (Lent):
Balance = Sum(Lent amounts) - Sum(Lent Return amounts)

Per Contact Balance (Borrowed):
Balance = Sum(Borrowed amounts) - Sum(Borrow Return amounts)
```

### Financial Summary Impact:
```
Net Balance Calculation:
= Total Income - Total Expense 
  + Total Borrowed - Total Lent 
  + Total Lent Returned - Total Borrow Returned

Lending Balance:
= Money Lent (pending) - Money Borrowed (pending)
```
