## Known Issues & Limitations

1. **Data Persistence:** All data is in-memory (lost on app restart)
   - **Solution:** Need to implement SQLite/SharedPreferences
   
2. **Push Notifications:** No actual push notifications yet
   - **Solution:** Need to add local notifications package
   
3. **Theme Persistence:** Theme preference not saved
   - **Solution:** Add SharedPreferences for theme

4. **Recurring Processing:** Only runs on startup
   - **Solution:** Add background processing or scheduler

---

## Next Steps (Priority Order)

1. **Add Data Persistence (CRITICAL)**
   - Use SQLite or SharedPreferences
   - Save all transactions, recurring, reminders
   - Implement data migration

2. **Add Local Notifications**
   - Use flutter_local_notifications package
   - Schedule notifications for reminders
   - Daily check for recurring transactions

3. **Improve Recurring Logic**
   - Edit recurring transactions
   - Skip one occurrence
   - View transaction history from recurring

4. **Add More Analytics**
   - Monthly trends
   - Category comparisons
   - Spending predictions

5. **Export/Import Improvements**
   - Support more formats (CSV, Excel)
   - Backup to cloud
   - Auto-backup option

## Code Quality Notes

- ✅ All new code follows Flutter best practices
- ✅ Consistent naming conventions
- ✅ Proper separation of concerns (models/services/screens)
- ✅ Reusable widgets and components
- ✅ Error handling in place
- ⚠️ No unit tests yet (should add)
- ⚠️ No integration tests yet (should add)

---

## Performance Notes

- App loads quickly
- Smooth animations
- No major performance issues observed
- Large transaction lists may need pagination in future

---

## Comparison to Competition

### What We Now Have
- ✅ Recurring transactions (like Money Manager)
- ✅ Reminders (like Wallet)
- ✅ Dark mode (like most modern apps)
- ✅ Search & filters (like Money Lover)
- ✅ Import/Export (like AndroMoney)

### What We Still Lack
- ❌ Bank sync (like Mint, YNAB)
- ❌ Cloud backup (like Money Manager)
- ❌ Investment tracking (like ET Money)
- ❌ Bill splitting (like Splitwise)
- ❌ Receipt scanning (like Expensify)

---

## User Experience Improvements

1. **Onboarding:** Need welcome screens for first-time users
2. **Tutorial:** Add feature tour
3. **Tooltips:** Add hints for complex features
4. **Accessibility:** Improve screen reader support
5. **Error Messages:** Make error messages more user-friendly

---

## Technical Debt

1. Some services could be refactored for better testability
2. Need to add proper error logging
3. Should implement proper state management (Provider/Riverpod)
4. Need to add analytics tracking
5. Should implement proper dependency injection
