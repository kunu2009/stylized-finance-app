# 🎨 Category Cards Layout Fix

**Date:** October 4, 2025  
**Issue:** Overlapping text in budget category cards  
**Status:** ✅ Fixed & APK Rebuilt  

---

## 🐛 Issue Fixed

### **Problem:**
Looking at your screenshot, the category cards had text display issues:
- "ADDED ₹257 ONLY LEFT ₹4,743" text was overlapping with "of ₹5,000"
- Text was cramped and hard to read
- Single line RichText widget causing layout issues

### **Solution:**
- ✅ Split text into **two separate rows** for better readability
- ✅ First row: "ADDED ₹257 ONLY LEFT"
- ✅ Second row: "₹4,743 of ₹5,000"
- ✅ Slightly reduced font size to 9px (from 10px) for better fit
- ✅ Maintained color coding (grey labels, bold amounts, red when over budget)

## 📐 Layout Changes

### **Before:**
```
🍽️ Food & Dining              5%
ADDED ₹257 ONLY LEFT ₹4,743 of ₹5,000  ← All in one line, overlapping!
[Progress bar]
```

### **After:**
```
🍽️ Food & Dining              5%
ADDED ₹257 ONLY LEFT           ← Row 1
₹4,743 of ₹5,000              ← Row 2 (clear and readable!)
[Progress bar]
```

## 💻 Code Changes

**File:** `lib/widgets/category_budget_card.dart`

**Changed from RichText to Two Rows:**

```dart
// Before: Single RichText widget
RichText(
  text: TextSpan(children: [
    TextSpan(text: 'ADDED '),
    TextSpan(text: '₹257'),
    TextSpan(text: ' ONLY LEFT '),
    TextSpan(text: '₹4,743'),
  ]),
),
Text('of ₹5,000'),

// After: Two separate Row widgets
Row(
  children: [
    Text('ADDED '),
    Text('₹257', style: bold),
    Text(' ONLY LEFT '),
  ],
),
Row(
  children: [
    Text('₹4,743', style: bold),
    Text(' of ₹5,000'),
  ],
),
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ No overlapping text
- ✅ Better line breaks
- ✅ Easier to read
- ✅ Consistent spacing
