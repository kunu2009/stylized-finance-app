Once deployed, update the APK download link in your landing page:

1. Upload `app-release.apk` to your repository
2. Update the download link to:
   ```
   https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/7k-money-landing/raw/main/build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-release.apk
   ```

Or use a file hosting service like:
- Google Drive
- Dropbox
- GitHub Releases

### Environment URLs
