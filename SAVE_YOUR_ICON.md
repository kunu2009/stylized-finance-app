# 🎨 IMPORTANT: Save Your Custom Icon!

## ⚠️ ACTION REQUIRED

The current setup is using a temporary icon. To use YOUR custom "7K Money" logo (the one you attached with "7K" text and money bag), please follow these steps:

### Step 1: Save the Icon Image
1. **Find your logo image** (the one you attached in the chat)
   - It should show "7K" text with a money bag
   - Background should be beige/tan color

2. **Save it** with these specs:
   - **File name**: `icon.png`
   - **Location**: Save it in `C:\Desktop\7K\7kmoney\assets\app_icon\icon.png`
   - **Replace** the existing icon.png file
   
3. **Image Requirements**:
   - Format: PNG
   - Recommended size: 1024x1024 pixels (minimum 512x512)
   - The current placeholder will work, but your custom icon will look better!

### Step 2: Regenerate Icons
After saving your custom icon.png, run:

```powershell
# Navigate to project folder
cd C:\Desktop\7K\7kmoney

# Generate icons
flutter pub run flutter_launcher_icons

# Rebuild APK
flutter clean
flutter build apk --release

# Copy to web
copy build\app\outputs\flutter-apk\app-release.apk web\downloads\7k-money.apk
```

### Or Use the Automated Script:
```powershell
.\setup_icon.ps1
```
